## Get Start

## Description

This project involves developing a Flask-based platform that dynamically distributes static content stored in JSON/YAML format. The platform is deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and uses a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test and deployment processes.

## Architecture

#### Version management with Git: Use Git to track changes and manage branches.
#### Application Flask: REST API for accessing JSON/YAML content.
#### Containerization with Docker: The application is packaged in a Docker container.
#### Orchestration with Kubernetes: Application deployment on AKS.
#### CI/CD pipeline: Automate deployment with GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps.
#### Monitoring and logging: Use of Azure Monitor and Kubernetes Logging.
#### Security: Secret management and secure authentication with Azure Managed Identities.
